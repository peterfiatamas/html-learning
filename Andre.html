<b>Maurice André</b> (born 21 May 1933 in Alès and died 25 February 2012 in Bayonne) was a French trumpeter, active in the classical music field.<br>
He was professor of trumpet at the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique in Paris where he introduced the teaching of the piccolo trumpet including the <br>
Baroque repertoire on trumpet. André inspired many innovations on his instrument, and his technical mastery and profound artistry has contributed over fifty <br>
years to popularize the trumpet worldwide.<br>

recognized by his peers as the greatest classical trumpet player of the century.<br>
